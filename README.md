# On a Shrunk Natural Number Model within ZFC: The Existence of ℵ₋₁

## Abstract
    This paper presents a new model of natural numbers within the framework of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZFC) that leads to the existence of the cardinal number ℵ₋₁. By shrinking the traditional natural number model, we provide a constructive approach that challenges the conventional hierarchy of cardinalities. Crucially, this result is obtained without any use of forcing, external universes, or metamathematical assumptions—only standard ZFC tools are employed. The existence of ℵ₋₁, induced through this process, offers a new analytical perspective on the hierarchy of infinities.
